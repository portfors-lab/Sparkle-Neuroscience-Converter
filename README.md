### Instructions:
1. Select a file by searching for it with the "Browse" button or try typing the absolute path to the file.
2. Once a file is chosen, the test drop-down list should auto populate itself with the available tests. Choose a test to extract data from.
3. After you select the test you will need to choose the threshold you wish to use to calculate spikes. **CAUTION:** If the test contains multiple channels you will need to set multiple threshold values. To do this simply select a channel with the drop-down list and set the threshold. Repeat this for each channel.
4. The stimulus window allows you to extend the time frame for counting spikes. When this value is positive it will add time to each stimulus by cutting into the following silence period.
5. When you have finished setting all of your parameters press the "Start" button to generate your .stam and .stad files.

### TODO:
* Add Sparkle Neuroscience Converter features to Sparkle Analysis
